## STF DDS Converter

STF DDS Converter is a lightweight desktop tool designed to convert between `.stf` textures and `.dds` graphics. STF textures are used in **[Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Flashpoint:_Dragon_Rising)**, a tactical military shooter developed by [Codemasters](https://www.codemasters.com). Whether you're modding menus, updating textures, or rebuilding UI layouts, this tool helps you batch-convert files with ease.

Built with WPF and styled for clarity, the converter features a bold yellow/grey theme, Orbitron Black branding, and pixel-perfect UI alignment.
